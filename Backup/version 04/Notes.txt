Naming convention:
method name start with a verb. (readFile, writeFile)
class name using its functionality in a generalized name.(TextWriter, TextReader, TextCreater)
Variable name should start with small case.
Don’t declare two variables in a same line.

Modifiers:
Use private for variables and methods that is not called outside the class.
Avoid accessing variables of a class outside directly, instead put a getter method for that variable and use it.

default modifier should not be used anywhere in program
local variables has no access modifiers
member variables must be always private unless it is used outside the class
use getter and setter method to access the private variables

Collections:
Its size is growable and not like array whose size is fixed.
It can hold different objects and primitive data types whereas array is a collection of members of same data type.
Collections can be generalized using Generics which tells the collection to accept only specific time of objects to store in it.
Avoid using arrays for holding objects, instead use list.
 
Avoid declaring variables inside loop as it may allocate space for variable in each iteration and hence it affects performance.
Don’t repeat same set of coding in any place. Instead create a common method and use it.
Try to generalize the classes and separate it from business logic and thereby you can use the generalize class in many other areas.
